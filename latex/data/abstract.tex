\indent The Higgs boson discovery was announces on July 4th, 2012. Since then the 125\unit{\GeV} boson has been seen in many decay paths, including $H{\rightarrow}\gamma\gamma$, $H{\rightarrow}ZZ$, $H{\rightarrow}\tau\tau$, and even some $H{\rightarrow}W^{+}W^{-}$ channels.
However, no one has looked for the boson at this mass in the $H{\rightarrow}W^{+}W^{-}{\rightarrow}l{\nu}jj$.
This dissertation presents a search for the 125\unit{\GeV} Higgs in semi-leptonic W decays using both traditional kinetically discriminating variables as well as a matrix element technique.
The data for this analysis was collected in 2012 by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and amounts to 19.7\unit{\fbinv} of proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 8\unit{\TeV}.
Although this analysis presents a step forward in complexity, we were still not able to see a significant excess above the standard model background prediction.
However, we were able to set limits on the $\sigma\times{BR}$ for the semi-leptonic W decay of the Higgs boson.
PUT LIMITS HERE.
These represent some of the first such limits recorded.
